# 10 Sec Math Game Project - Altcademy
---

#### User needs to input the correct answer to a basic arihmetic equation. There is a limit of 10 seconds for which the user can input the correct answer and progress to the next question.

#### If the user runs out of time, game ends. If the user makes a correct guess, an additional 1 second is added to the available time. 

#### Minimum requirements: 

1. An input for the user to type the answer (Event Listener)

2. An element displays the current math equation question (DOM manipulation)

3. Equation uses "+" operators only (function)

4. A count down for the time left (Interval,Time, DOM manipulation)

5. Game starts when the user clicks a button or starts typing the input (Event Listener)
 
6. Game ends when the user runs out of time (Interval, Time, Function)

7. The user makes a correct guess, add 1 second to the available time left (Function)

8. The current score is shown (DOM manipulation)

9. A way to restart the game if time runs out (Function)
